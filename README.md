This is a very simple sudoku generator and solver I created in December 2022

It is a simple backtracking program. The generation is done simply by solving in a random order, and then removing squares

```
make
./main    # or however the compiled binary is named
```


Further improvement: 
- add a gu
- png input
- solvable generation
- hints
- solve step by step logically
